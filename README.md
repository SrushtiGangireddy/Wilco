# Wilco

Wilco is the construction company that was established two decades ago.

There are very few employees and the company manages all the stuff like payroll, EEOC Complaince and inventory management manually.

Our project has designed the ER model diagram based on the requirements of the company and developed the whole Database in Microsoft SQL.

The main issues the company was facing before designing this database were:

1. Complex payroll management
2. EEOC Complaince report generation each and every time
3. Inventory management

Our database has addressed all this issues and also we designed a website for this company.
